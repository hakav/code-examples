A bit of code from coursework to showcase what I've worked on!


Cut vertices:
This is a recursive linear time DFS-based algorithm to find the cut vertices of an undirected graph.


Image segmentation:
The problem is to find the best way to partition the given figure in two parts: a monochromatic rectangle and a monochromatic background. The objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors. Here data is a color image with ny * nx pixels, and in this task the image is monochromatic, with every pixel having RGB value (1,1,1) or (0,0,0).
