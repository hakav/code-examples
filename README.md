A bit of code from coursework to showcase what I've worked on!

Image segmentation:
The problem is to find the best way to partition the given figure in two parts: a monochromatic rectangle and a monochromatic background. The objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors. Here data is a color image with ny*nx pixels, and each pixel consists of three color components, red, green, and blue. In total, there are ny*nx*3 floating point numbers in the array data.
